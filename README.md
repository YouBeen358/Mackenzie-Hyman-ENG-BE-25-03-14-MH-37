This study investigates how optical tissue properties–scattering, retardance, and orientation–differ between control subjects (those with none or mild cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA) 
and those with severe CAA using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). Analysis across three tests evaluates tissue changes through disease stages and brain regions. 
Linear mixed models and zero-inflated models were used to detect group differences. Results suggest significant differences in scattering and retardance in experimental groups, 
particularly in frontal lobes with enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS). Exploratory data analysis revealed distinct distributional patterns and supported the modeling conclusions.
Models including LMM and Zero-Inflated model were used to investigate.
